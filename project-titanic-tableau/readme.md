## Titanic I. Project description

This was a guided project, that included a little bit of SQL, Python, and PowerBI.

## Goal: 
See if survival rate had anything to do with the passanger class. Also, assess the age of the passengers within each class to identify vulnerable age categories.

## Assessment: 
The data analytics dashboard highlights notable disparities in survival rates among Titanic passengers based on class and age. First-class passengers had a survival rate nearly three times higher than those in third class, emphasizing the value of analyzing survival percentages rather than absolute numbers.

In first class, the overall survival rate was approximately 60%. However, focusing on class-specific percentages reveals even greater variations, underscoring the need for detailed analysis.

Age was another key factor in survival. All second-class children survived, compared to 80% of first-class children and just 40% of third-class children. Among seniors, no one survived in the second and third classes, while only 17% (one individual) survived in the first class. A deeper statistical analysis is needed to determine whether this low survival rate among first-class seniors is statistically significant or simply due to chance.

Recommendations:

• Focus on minimizing the disparity between passenger classes.

• Investigate emergency accessibility measures to improve survival rates for all age categories across all classes.

• Use these insights to initiate further data analysis (statistical analysis) to design ships that ensure more equitable safety provisions for all passengers, regardless of class or age.
