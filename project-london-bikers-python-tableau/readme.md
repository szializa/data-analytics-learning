# London Bikers 

It was an exciting guided project from Mo Chen.
The dataset is from Kaggle:
[kaggle.com/bike-rides-in-london](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufyilmazyz/bike-rides-in-london)

I attached the raw file, you can find it as 'london_merged_csv'.

## Data Cleaning in Python

You can check the code in the attached .ipynb file.
Also, I attached the excel file with the cleaned data (london-bikes-final) that we used for the Tableau dashboard.

## Data Visualization in Tableau
