# About me

Hi, 

It's Liza. I’m sharing some projects I’ve worked on as I learn to become a Data and BI Analyst.
I’m studying SQL, Tableau, Power BI, a bit of Python, and advancing my Excel skills. 

My goal is to land in a role where I can analyze data and 
help businesses make decisions through meaningful insights, 
as this is what interests me the most. 
Since almost everything is data-driven nowadays, I believe it’s a great path to pursue.

In my previous jobs, the tasks I enjoyed the most were exploring datasets, 
cleaning them, and creating impactful charts and visualizations. 
Now, I’m following my passion, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.

Anyway, my long-term goal is to become a Data Scientist someday,
so I'm revisiting statistics (since I’ve forgotten a lot since university) 
and plan to learn about Machine Learning and AI tools in the future.

I am motivated and constantly preparing myself for the future, and for my future self, 
so I am eager to learn and continue to develop and expand my knowledge.
