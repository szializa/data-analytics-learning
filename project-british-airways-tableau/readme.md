It was also a guided project (from Mo Chen).

Here, in this guided project we explored the reviews about the services of British Airways.
The travelers could rate each service (1-5) and give an overall rating for the airline (1-10). In our visualization, we can filter the data and investigate the ratings regarding each of the services, periods, traveler type, seat type, certain aircraft, and the continent where the travelers came from. 

On the top line of the visualization, we can see the average ratings for each service without any filtering, and consequently, we can say that there are two main services that should have been improved by the airline: Entertainment and Food. The average ratings of these two services are below 2.5, so I would consider exploring the reasons why visitors found them so poor. If we check the data from 2023, we can see that the worst rating is associated with the A321 Aircraft (0.8 points) and the least satisfied travelers departed from Canada (0.7 points), Ireland, France, United Arab Emirates, and South Africa (all others scored 1.0 points, but only one traveler rated from each of these countries). Therefore, perhaps our sample is too small to make a decision and improve the food service, investing a lot of money in finding the best solutions, but small changes could still make a difference if we aim to improve that.
On the other hand, Entertainment is a somewhat unclear concept if we talk about an airline, so I would focus on Food. 

Nevertheless, two more services are below 3.0 points, namely Seat Comfort and Value for Money. Off the top of my head, I would say that the acceptable rating should be at least 60% (or I would prefer 70%, but since itâ€™s not my company, I understand there might be other priorities), which is 3.0 point, so probably these services also need some improvement.
Considering the Seat Comfort, if we investigated the reasons, the issue could be related to hygiene which can be improved more easily (and affordable) than exchanging the seats.
